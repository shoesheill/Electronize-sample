# Packaging an ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Page Application as a Desktop Executable with Electron.NET and CoreAdmin

This guide demonstrates how to package an ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Page application as a standalone desktop executable using **Electron.NET** and integrate **CoreAdmin** for managing the admin dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (5.0 or later)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Electron.NET CLI
- CoreAdmin NuGet package

## 1. Set Up Electron.NET in Your MVC or Razor Page Project

### Install Electron.NET CLI

Open a terminal and install the Electron.NET CLI globally:

```bash
dotnet tool install ElectronNET.CLI -g
dotnet new tool-manifest
```

### Add Electron.NET to Your Project

In your MVC or Razor Page project, add the Electron.NET API package by running:

```bash
dotnet add package ElectronNET.API
```

### Initialize Electron.NET

Open `Program.cs` and configure Electron.NET by adding setup:

```csharp
builder.WebHost.UseElectron(args);
```

### Enable Electron Startup

In `Program.cs`, before `app.Run()`, add the following code to open a new Electron window:

```csharp
if (HybridSupport.IsElectronActive)
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());
```

## 2. Set Up CoreAdmin in Your Project

### Install CoreAdmin NuGet Package

To use CoreAdmin in your project, you need to add the **CoreAdmin** NuGet package. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package CoreAdmin
```

### Configure CoreAdmin in `Program.cs`

In your `Program.cs`, configure **CoreAdmin** by calling `AddCoreAdmin()`:

```csharp
using ElectronNET.API;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using WebApplication5.Data;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.UseElectron(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();  // Add Razor Pages service
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlite("Data Source=app.db"));
builder.Services.AddCoreAdmin();  // Add CoreAdmin services

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts(); // Ensures security headers for production
}

var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
var pendingMigrations = dbContext.Database.GetPendingMigrations();
if (pendingMigrations.Any()) dbContext.Database.Migrate();  // Apply pending migrations

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();  // Use static files for assets like CSS, JS, images
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthorization();  // Add authorization middleware

// Map Razor Pages and Controllers
app.MapRazorPages();  // Map Razor Pages
app.MapControllers();  // Map Controllers
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();  // Default route for controllers

// Set custom CoreAdmin title for the admin panel
app.UseCoreAdminCustomTitle("Admin Dashboard");

if (HybridSupport.IsElectronActive)
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());  // Create Electron window if active

app.Run();
```

### CoreAdmin Integration

CoreAdmin is now integrated by simply calling `AddCoreAdmin()`. No further custom configuration for themes, layout, or home page URL is required, as CoreAdmin comes with a default configuration. 

If you want to customize aspects of CoreAdmin (like adding your own views or layouts), you can refer to the **CoreAdmin documentation** for more advanced configurations.

### Razor Pages, Static Files, and Controller Routes

- **Razor Pages**: CoreAdmin uses Razor Pages for rendering views, so it's important to map Razor Pages using `app.MapRazorPages()`.
  
- **Static Files**: The `app.UseStaticFiles()` middleware is essential for serving static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files. This is especially important for admin interfaces that need these files to render properly.

- **Controller Routes**: For CoreAdmin to work properly, `app.MapControllers()` and `app.MapDefaultControllerRoute()` should be set up to handle any controllers that might be used alongside the admin panel.

### Automatically Apply Database Migrations

To ensure the database is created and migrations are applied automatically on startup, you can use this code in the `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
var pendingMigrations = dbContext.Database.GetPendingMigrations();
if (pendingMigrations.Any()) dbContext.Database.Migrate();  // Apply any pending migrations
```

This ensures that when the app starts, it checks if there are any pending migrations and applies them to the database.

## 3. Build the Electron App

### Initialize Electron

To initialize Electron for your app, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet electronize init
```

### Start the App in Electron

To start the app in **Electron** during development, use:

```bash
dotnet electronize start
```

### Package the App as an Executable

Once the app works as expected, you can package it as an executable for different platforms. To package for Windows, run:

```bash
dotnet electronize build /target win
```

Change `/target` to `mac` or `linux` if you want to build for those platforms.

## 4. Ensure Migrations Are Included in Build Output

Ensure that migration files are included in your build output. Update your `.csproj` to include the migration files:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <None Update="Migrations\**\*">
        <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
</ItemGroup>
```

## 5. Summary

With this setup, your ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Page application will be packaged as an Electron desktop executable. CoreAdmin will be included as an admin dashboard. Additionally, database migrations will be applied automatically when the app starts, ensuring users don’t need to manually run any database setup commands. This approach makes the installation and initialization process seamless across different platforms.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and monitor your application with a powerful, default admin panel, while leveraging the capabilities of Electron to distribute it as a desktop application.

### Key Updates:

1. **CoreAdmin Integration**: Now, the setup only includes the correct method for adding **CoreAdmin** without custom configuration, making it simpler and based on the default CoreAdmin setup.

2. **Razor Pages, Static Files, and Controller Routes**: These critical aspects are now clearly mentioned to ensure that CoreAdmin works as expected. Static files and controller routes are essential for CoreAdmin’s functionality.

3. **Database Migration**: Automatically applying database migrations on startup is included, making sure the database is up-to-date when the app runs.

This version should work seamlessly with the CoreAdmin package, offering a clean, functional setup for your admin dashboard inside an Electronized .NET Core app.
