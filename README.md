Sure! Below is a new markdown that focuses only on integrating **CoreAdmin** into the existing ASP.NET Core MVC application, while keeping the other Electron-related parts as they are:

# Packaging an ASP.NET Core MVC Application as a Desktop Executable with Electron.NET and CoreAdmin

This guide demonstrates how to package an ASP.NET Core MVC application as a standalone desktop executable using **Electron.NET** and integrate **CoreAdmin** to manage the admin dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (5.0 or later)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Electron.NET CLI
- CoreAdmin NuGet package

## 1. Set Up CoreAdmin in Your MVC Project

### Install CoreAdmin NuGet Package

To use CoreAdmin, first, add the **CoreAdmin** NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package CoreAdmin
```

### Configure CoreAdmin in `Program.cs`

In your `Program.cs`, after configuring your services for **Razor Pages** and **Electron.NET**, you can set up **CoreAdmin**:

```csharp
using ElectronNET.API;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using WebApplication5.Data;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.UseElectron(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlite("Data Source=app.db"));
builder.Services.AddCoreAdmin(); // Add CoreAdmin services

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
var pendingMigrations = dbContext.Database.GetPendingMigrations();
if (pendingMigrations.Any()) dbContext.Database.Migrate();

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthorization();

// Map Razor Pages and Controllers
app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapControllers();
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

// Set Custom CoreAdmin Title
app.UseCoreAdminCustomTitle("Admin Dashboard");

if (HybridSupport.IsElectronActive)
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());

app.Run();
```

### Customizing CoreAdmin Settings

You can customize CoreAdmin with different settings. For instance, you can set the **home page URL** or change the **theme** of the dashboard:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddCoreAdmin(config =>
{
    config.UseCoreAdminCustomConfig = options =>
    {
        options.HomePageUrl = "/admin/dashboard";  // Custom dashboard URL
        options.Theme = CoreAdmin.Theme.Dark;      // Dark mode theme
        options.Layout = CoreAdmin.Layout.Vertical; // Vertical layout for navigation
    };
});
```

### Automatically Apply Database Migrations

CoreAdmin often requires a database to work with. In this setup, your **AppDbContext** will use an **SQLite** database. Make sure that migrations are applied automatically on startup:

```csharp
var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
var pendingMigrations = dbContext.Database.GetPendingMigrations();
if (pendingMigrations.Any()) dbContext.Database.Migrate();
```

### Run Electron Window

If **Electron.NET** is active, it will automatically create an Electron window to display the application:

```csharp
if (HybridSupport.IsElectronActive)
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());
```

## 2. Building and Packaging the Electron App

### Initialize Electron

To initialize Electron for your app:

```bash
dotnet electronize init
```

### Start the App in Electron

Run the app in **Electron** during development:

```bash
dotnet electronize start
```

### Package the App as an Executable

Once the app works as expected, package it as an executable:

```bash
dotnet electronize build /target win
```

This will package the app for Windows. Change `/target` to `mac` or `linux` as needed for other platforms.

## 3. Ensure Migrations Are Included in Build Output

Ensure that migration files are copied to the output directory when building the app. Update your `.csproj` to include the migration files:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <None Update="Migrations\**\*">
        <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
</ItemGroup>
```

## Summary

With this setup, your ASP.NET Core MVC application will be packaged as an Electron desktop executable, and CoreAdmin will provide a powerful admin dashboard. Additionally, any pending database migrations will be applied automatically when the app starts, making it easier to manage data initialization without manual intervention.
```

### Key Points in the New Section:

1. **CoreAdmin Integration**: We added the necessary configuration to use CoreAdmin within the application by registering it in the `Program.cs` and customizing its settings.

2. **Database Migrations**: Code for automatic database migration ensures that when the app starts, it creates or updates the database schema as needed.

3. **Electron Window**: The setup includes an Electron window that will show the CoreAdmin dashboard, and this is automatically initialized when running the app in an Electron environment.

4. **Packaging**: The instructions remain the same for building and packaging the app with Electron.NET, and the database migrations are included in the packaging process.

This structure provides clear integration between **CoreAdmin**, **Electron**, and **ASP.NET Core MVC** while maintaining the steps for database initialization and packaging.
